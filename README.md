# ThresholdLineRangeChart
ExtJs 4.x Chart Plugin that provides threshold lines and range colors for Radial and Cartesian based charts

Small proof of concept extension I created for the Chart's Gauge series. It allows you to specify the different slice ranges with start, end, and color. Also contains the ability to specify the needle width, color and pivot point attributes as well.

Drop the example files can just be dropped in the ExtJs 4.x library examples directory
